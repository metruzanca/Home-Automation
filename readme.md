# Home-Automation

This repo is just the start of my personal home automation.

In here you'll find all the services that I made or configured + docs on how to get them setup. You'll also find misc docs & resources on topics related to this project.

## Services contained in this Mono-repo:

- [BootHook-Service](BootHook-Service/readme.md): A small Nodejs Utility that uses discord webhooks to notify of restarts and display information such as IP (_important for me as I'm unanble to use static IPs due to my pretty bad router_)

## Misc Docs & Resources

[Compose on the Raspberry Pi](docs/raspberry-pi/Compose-on-the-Raspberry-Pi.md)
